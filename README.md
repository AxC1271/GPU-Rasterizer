# FPGA Rasterizer Implementation Overview
Welcome to the FPGA Rasterizer project! Inspired by my interest in computer graphics and digital design, this project aims to design and implement a simple graphics card on an FPGA using VHDL.
## Overview 
This project will not be started until Pixel-Gate is finished.
